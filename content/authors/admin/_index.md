Hi! I am a PhD student in Computer Vision under the supervision of Prof. Marc Pollefeys at the Computer Vision and Geometry Lab of ETH Zürich. Prior to starting my PhD at ETH Zurich, I graduated from the Robotics, Systems and Control masters program at ETH Zurich, where I focused on Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. While completing this program, I spent 5 months at Amazon Research as an Applied Science intern working on Computer Vision for Robotics. Furthermore, I co-founded a startup providing Data Analytics and Machine Learning services to financial institutions during my master studies. Besides my research, I serve as a scientific advisor to startups in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
